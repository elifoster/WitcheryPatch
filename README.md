# :bug: WitcheryPatch

WitcheryPatch is a small mod for Minecraft that uses ASM to fix some bugs within the Witchery
mod, since Emoniph, the developer of Witchery, has vanished.

## Bugs fixed by WitcheryPatch
### NEI Distillery
The NEI integration for the Distillery properly shows all recipes, rather than the first
matching one. For example, without WitcheryPatch, viewing the recipes for the Demonic Blood would
 show the recipe that takes a Demon Heart and a Diamond Vapor, but not the recipe that takes a
 Demon Heart and a Netherrack.
